X-Powered-By\n=================\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/helmetjs/hide-powered-by.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/helmetjs/hide-powered-by)\n\nSimple middleware to remove the `X-Powered-By` HTTP header if it's set.\n\nHackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in Express/Node if they see that your site is powered by Express (or whichever framework you use). For example, `X-Powered-By: Express` is sent in every HTTP request coming from Express, by default. This won't provide much security benefit ([as discussed here](https://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/2813#issuecomment-159270428)), but might help a tiny bit. It will also improve performance by reducing the number of bytes sent.\n\n```javascript\nconst hidePoweredBy = require('hide-powered-by')\napp.use(hidePoweredBy())\n```\n\nYou can also explicitly set the header to something else, if you want. This could throw people off:\n\n```javascript\napp.use(hidePoweredBy({ setTo: 'PHP 4.2.0' }))\n```\n\nNote: if you're using Express, you don't need this middleware and can just do this:\n\n```javascript\napp.disable('x-powered-by')\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"evanhahn","email":"me@evanhahn.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2022-06-18T20:38:12.119Z","created":"2014-10-28T14:05:43.752Z","0.1.0":"2014-10-28T14:05:43.752Z","1.0.0":"2015-12-18T18:42:55.823Z","1.1.0":"2019-05-26T19:07:41.569Z"},"homepage":"https://helmetjs.github.io/docs/hide-powered-by/","keywords":["helmet","security","express","connect","x-powered-by","powered-by"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/helmetjs/hide-powered-by.git"},"contributors":[{"name":"Evan Hahn","email":"me@evanhahn.com","url":"https://evanhahn.com"}],"author":{"name":"Adam Baldwin","email":"adam@npmjs.com","url":"https://evilpacket.net"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/helmetjs/hide-powered-by/issues","email":"me@evanhahn.com"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","license":"MIT","users":{"hugovila":true,"rocket0191":true,"colkito":true,"astesio":true}}
