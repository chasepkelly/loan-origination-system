Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

you're just unable to define new ones.\nFor example, proxying unrestricted dictionaries is not a good use-case for this polyfill.\n\nCurrently, the following traps are supported-\n\n* get\n* set\n* apply\n* construct\n\nThe `Proxy.revocable` [method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy/revocable) is also supported, but only for calls to the above traps.\n\nThis has no external dependencies.\nSkip down to [usage](#usage) to get started.\n\n# Example\n\nThe most compelling use case for `Proxy` is to provide change notifications.\n\n```js\nfunction observe(o, callback) {\n  return new Proxy(o, {\n    set(target, property, value) {\n      callback(property, value);\n      target[property] = value;\n    },\n  });\n}\n\nconst x = {'name': 'BB-8'};\nconst p = observe(x, (property, value) => console.info(property, value));\np.name = 'BB-9';\n// name BB-9\n```\n\nYou can extend this to generate change notifications for anywhere in an object tree-\n\n```js\nfunction observe(o, callback) {\n  function buildProxy(prefix, o) {\n    return new Proxy(o, {\n      set(target, property, value) {\n        // same as above, but add prefix\n        callback(prefix + property, value);\n        target[property] = value;\n      },\n      get(target, property) {\n        // return a new proxy if possible, add to prefix\n        const out = target[property];\n        if (out instanceof Object) {\n          return buildProxy(prefix + property + '.', out);\n        }\n        return out;  // primitive, ignore\n      },\n    });\n  }\n\n  return buildProxy('', o);\n}\n\nconst x = {'model': {name: 'LEAF'}};\nconst p = observe(x, (property, value) => console.info(property, value));\np.model.name = 'Tesla';\n// model.name Tesla\n```\n\n## Adding new properties\n\nThe following line will fail (with a `TypeError` in strict mode) with the polyfill, as it's unable to intercept _new_ properties-\n\n```js\np.model.year = 2016;  // error in polyfill\n```\n\nHowever, you can replace the entire object at once - once you access it again, your code will see the proxied version.\n\n```js\np.model = {name: 'Falcon', year: 2016};\n// model Object {name: \"Falcon\", year: 2016}\n```\n\nFor a similar reason, this polyfill can't proxy `Array` objects very well - but you can replace them all at once.\n\n# Usage\n\nInstall via your favourite package manager as `proxy-polyfill`.\n\n## To polyfill Proxy everywhere\n\nYou should include `proxy-polyfill` into your build system (just require it directly, it doesn't export anything), or import the `proxy.min.js` file directly.\nThis is the recommended approach and works on the web, in Node, or React Native.\n\n## To consume the polyfill as a function\n\nRequires `./src/proxy.js`, which exports a proxy polyfill _builder_ function in commonJS.\n\n```js\n// commonJS require\nconst proxyPolyfill = require('proxy-polyfill/src/proxy')();\n\n// Your environment may also support transparent rewriting of commonJS to ES6:\nimport ProxyPolyfillBuilder from 'proxy-polyfill/src/proxy';\nconst proxyPolyfill = ProxyPolyfillBuilder();\n\n// Then use...\nconst myProxy = new proxyPolyfill(...);\n```\n\n# Support\n\nThe polyfill supports browsers that implement the full [ES5 spec](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/), such as IE9+ and Safari 6+.\nIt may work in other non-browser environments too.\n\nNote that Firefox, Chrome, Safari 10+ and Edge support `Proxy` natively.\nYou don't need this if you're only targeting these modern browsers.\n\n","maintainers":[{"email":"sam.thorogood@gmail.com","name":"samthor"},{"email":"node-team-npm+wombot@google.com","name":"google-wombot"}],"time":{"modified":"2022-06-24T22:02:32.796Z","created":"2016-02-29T08:42:13.438Z","0.1.0":"2016-02-29T08:42:13.438Z","0.1.1":"2016-02-29T08:51:13.214Z","0.1.2":"2016-03-11T02:56:06.723Z","0.1.3":"2016-03-27T14:24:56.053Z","0.1.5":"2016-05-03T00:26:09.639Z","0.1.6":"2016-06-29T04:10:46.309Z","0.1.7":"2017-05-31T23:53:54.917Z","0.2.0":"2018-03-08T22:39:56.822Z","0.3.0":"2018-06-03T23:19:58.697Z","0.3.1":"2020-02-21T02:28:57.959Z","0.3.2":"2020-07-01T00:50:29.117Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/GoogleChrome/proxy-polyfill#readme","keywords":["polyfill","html5","proxy","es6"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/GoogleChrome/proxy-polyfill.git"},"author":{"name":"The Chromium Authors"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/GoogleChrome/proxy-polyfill/issues"},"license":"Apache-2.0","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"samthor":true}}
