To include the polyfill you need to require it at the top of the entry point to your application.\r\n\r\n```\r\nrequire('babelify-es6-polyfill');\r\n```\r\n","versions":{"1.0.3":{"name":"babelify-es6-polyfill","version":"1.0.3","main":"polyfill.js","description":"A pure ES5 and ES6 polyfill for babelify that only includes standardised features","author":{"name":"Jason Berry","email":"jason@thevagabond.net"},"license":"MIT","keywords":["es6","ecmascript 6","es2015","babel","babelify","shim","polyfill"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/airmanx86/babelify-es6-polyfill.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/airmanx86/babelify-es6-polyfill/issues"},"dependencies":{"core-js":"^1.0.1","regenerator":"0.8.35"},"gitHead":"f44d8e423a6de937488c4a92c21ec0e780cac472","homepage":"https://github.com/airmanx86/babelify-es6-polyfill","_id":"babelify-es6-polyfill@1.0.3","scripts":{},"_shasum":"0fe0ebf2ba75ed39dcad479581142a67863f9904","_from":".","_npmVersion":"2.7.4","_nodeVersion":"0.12.2","_npmUser":{"name":"airmanx86","email":"airmanx86@hotmail.com"},"dist":{"shasum":"0fe0ebf2ba75ed39dcad479581142a67863f9904","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/babelify-es6-polyfill/-/babelify-es6-polyfill-1.0.3.tgz","integrity":"sha512-lEnH6jJQXNrvL1fURSoy4g8P6hdBucKxd7ah3ouNU6UH3DHwPvyvAWMC3fdmaH3rm1hw2yDOcwjoGsaruUq6Dg==","signatures":[{"keyid":"SHA256:jl3bwswu80PjjokCgh0o2w5c2U4LhQAE57gj9cz1kzA","sig":"MEQCIFh5g7ZjmaP3A6H+YiBXKmSx0Qyrc5DC/PSavwKWDUsKAiAH5nx//rcgiiZW+xrj1rGe3ThQ2x7HnAN44HnIvjcOcw=="}]},"maintainers":[{"name":"airmanx86","email":"airmanx86@hotmail.com"}]},"1.0.4":{"name":"babelify-es6-polyfill","version":"1.0.4","main":"polyfill.js","description":"A pure ES5 and ES6 polyfill for babelify that only includes standardised features","author":{"name":"Jason Berry","email":"jason@thevagabond.net"},"license":"MIT","keywords":["es6","ecmascript 6","es2015","babel","babelify","shim","polyfill"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/airmanx86/babelify-es6-polyfill.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/airmanx86/babelify-es6-polyfill/issues"},"dependencies":{"core-js":"1.1.0","regenerator":"0.8.36"},"gitHead":"d4ba318f936601dfa986fa955ccdbc2b33a2d5a1","homepage":"https://github.com/airmanx86/babelify-es6-polyfill","_id":"babelify-es6-polyfill@1.0.4","scripts":{},"_shasum":"2e862fb4981aea506ebef0aaed1970113c1b4651","_from":".","_npmVersion":"2.7.4","_nodeVersion":"0.12.2","_npmUser":{"name":"airmanx86","email":"airmanx86@hotmail.com"},"dist":{"shasum":"2e862fb4981aea506ebef0aaed1970113c1b4651","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/babelify-es6-polyfill/-/babelify-es6-polyfill-1.0.4.tgz","integrity":"sha512-zwWOE1paKxk8JyLkfpQcERAVa+//3siMBI3//dJpyRDrWyb062AIUsb/0BvLl2xjbBJ5T5ZXf0MC4SLKBmbkeg==","signatures":[{"keyid":"SHA256:jl3bwswu80PjjokCgh0o2w5c2U4LhQAE57gj9cz1kzA","sig":"MEUCIE0k8J6+p0O0C8ZOvlRwa5OxDj/8MVH42f2kDU4fTW3mAiEApFD5oBj9dzMm1rCgc0ZJPPkfMQsB62Xg1NrvvyEj2iQ="}]},"maintainers":[{"name":"airmanx86","email":"airmanx86@hotmail.com"}]}},"homepage":"https://github.com/airmanx86/babelify-es6-polyfill","keywords":["es6","ecmascript 6","es2015","babel","babelify","shim","polyfill"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/airmanx86/babelify-es6-polyfill.git"},"author":{"name":"Jason Berry","email":"jason@thevagabond.net"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/airmanx86/babelify-es6-polyfill/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
